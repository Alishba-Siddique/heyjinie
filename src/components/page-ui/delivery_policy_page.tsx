            At Heyjinie, we are committed to ensuring a seamless and timely
            delivery experience for our users. This Delivery Policy outlines the
            terms and conditions related to the delivery of orders placed
            through our platform.

            <span className="font-bold text-xl">Delivery Timeframes</span>
            <br />
            <br />
            Delivery times vary depending on the Vendor, product availability,
            and delivery location. Estimated delivery times are displayed during
            the checkout process. Standard delivery times may range from 30
            minutes to 5 business days for physical goods, depending on the
            nature of the order. Delays may occur due to adverse weather
            conditions, vendor or delivery partner constraints, incomplete or
            incorrect delivery address details, or force majeure events.
            <br />

            <span className="font-bold text-xl">Delivery Charges</span>
            <br />
            <br />
            Delivery fees are calculated based on the delivery location and
            order type and will be clearly mentioned at checkout. Additional
            charges may apply for express or same-day deliveries, and these
            charges will be communicated before order confirmation.

              Delivery Address Guidelines
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            Users are required to provide a complete and accurate delivery
            address, including any specific instructions such as apartment
            numbers or landmarks. Changes to the delivery address after placing
            an order may not always be possible. Please contact customer support
            immediately for assistance. If delivery fails due to incorrect
            address details, unavailability of the recipient, or refusal to
            accept the order, the user may be charged a re-delivery fee.

            <span className="font-bold text-xl">Order Tracking</span>
            <br />
            <br />
            Users can track the status of their orders through the "My Orders"
            section of the Heyjinie platform. Notifications will be sent at each
            stage of the delivery process. In some cases, users may be able to
            directly communicate with delivery partners for specific
            instructions or updates.

            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            If a delivery cannot be completed due to vendor or delivery partner
            issues, Heyjinie will notify the user and provide a resolution,
            which may include re-delivery or refunds to the Heyjinie Wallet. It
            is the user's responsibility to ensure availability at the specified
            delivery address during the estimated delivery window.

            <span className="font-bold text-xl">Return Deliveries</span>
            <br />
            <br />
            If a return is initiated, users will bear the cost of return
            delivery unless the issue is caused by the Vendor, such as a wrong
            or damaged item. The return delivery charges will be deducted from
            the Heyjinie Wallet refund amount, if applicable.

            Heyjinieâ€™s delivery services may be limited to specific locations.
            Users are advised to check serviceability for their area during
